h1. grrid

h3. A Javascript grid control using Prototype.js.

Grrid is a pure javascript spreadsheet-like grid. You can edit the cells' contents inline (as opposed to pop-ups like in many other grid implementations).  It uses Google-maps style scrolling, so that the browser only needs to load the visible contents.  Edits are periodically synchronized with the server.

This project is still just in its infancy, and there are a few features missing, so I wouldn't recommend using it in production just yet. If you want to contribute, or have any comments, please message me.
